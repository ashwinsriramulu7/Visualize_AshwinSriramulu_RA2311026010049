Problem Statement:
  The absence of a structured and efficient platform for intra-community resource sharing results in unmet needs, resource underutilization, and diminished community engagement.

Introduction to the problem statement and solution:
  In large institutions, residential complexes, and other community-based settings, individuals often find themselves in need of everyday items or services that others within the same community may possess. However, there is no easy way for these needs to be communicated and fulfilled efficiently. This leads to unnecessary purchases, wastage of resources, and a missed opportunity for fostering community spirit.

For example, a student at SRMIST might urgently need a notebook but lacks an easy way to find someone nearby who has one to spare. Similarly, in a residential community like Purva Windermere, someone might need to borrow an electric cooker for a day but doesn’t know which neighbor might have one available. The lack of a streamlined communication channel for such requests results in unmet needs and the underutilization of available resources within the community.

We propose a mobile application that facilitates peer-to-peer resource sharing within defined communities, such as institutions, residential complexes, or any organized group. The app will allow users to post requests for items or services they need, which will then be visible to other members of the same community. Any member with the requested item or service can accept the request and communicate directly with the requester through the app’s messaging system to arrange the exchange.

This solution will:

1. Connect Community Members: Facilitate connections between individuals within the same community who can assist each other with their needs.
2. Enhance Resource Utilization: Maximize the use of available items and services, ensuring they reach those who need them, thereby minimizing waste.
3. Reduce Waste: Prevent unnecessary purchases and disposal by enabling items to be shared and reused within the community.

By providing a platform that simplifies resource sharing among community members, this app will help foster stronger, more interconnected communities where needs are met efficiently and sustainably.
